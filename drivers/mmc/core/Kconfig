config MMC_CLKGATE
	bool "MMC host clock gating"
	help
	  This will attempt to aggressively gate the clock to the MMC card.
	  This is done to save power due to gating off the logic and bus
	  noise when the MMC card is not in use. Your host driver has to
	  support handling this in order for it to be of any use.

	  If unsure, say N.

config MMC_RING_BUFFER
	bool "MMC_RING_BUFFER"
	depends on MMC
	default n
	help
	  This enables the ring buffer tracing of significant
	  events for mmc driver to provide command history for
	  debugging purpose.

	  If unsure, say N.

config MMC_EMBEDDED_SDIO
	boolean "MMC embedded SDIO device support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	help
	  If you say Y here, support will be added for embedded SDIO
	  devices which do not contain the necessary enumeration
	  support in hardware to be properly detected.

config MMC_PARANOID_SD_INIT
	bool "Enable paranoid SD card initialization (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	help
	  If you say Y here, the MMC layer will be extra paranoid
	  about re-trying SD init requests. This can be a useful
	  work-around for buggy controllers and hardware. Enable
	  if you are experiencing issues with SD detection.

config MMC_CMD_DEBUG
	bool "Debug feature to get mmc command issued"
	default n
	help
	  This is a debug feature to get the mmc command issued
	  in order to debug certain issues from the logs.

config MMC_CMD_QUEUE_SIZE
	int "mmc command queue size"
	depends on MMC_CMD_DEBUG
	default 256
	help
	  Select the size of the circular queue to store the MMC command
	  issued.

config MMC_DISABLE_SD_SDR104
	bool "Disable SD card speed bus mode SDR104"
	default y
	help
	  If you say N here, the SD layer uses a speed bus mode
	  of SDR104.
