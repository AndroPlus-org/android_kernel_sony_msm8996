wil6210 - Qualcomm Technologies Inc. 802.11ad Wireless Driver

wil6210 driver is responsible for managing 802.11ad chipset
connected to MSM over PCIe interface.

The platform data is needed in order to perform proper
bus-scaling and SMMU initialization by the driver.

Required properties:

- compatible: "qcom,wil6210"
- qcom,smmu-support: Boolean flag indicating whether PCIe has SMMU support
- qcom,pcie-parent: phandle for the PCIe root complex to which 11ad card is connected
- Refer to "Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/msm/msm_bus.txt" for
  the below optional properties:
	- qcom,msm-bus,name
	- qcom,msm-bus,num-cases
	- qcom,msm-bus,num-paths
	- qcom,msm-bus,vectors-KBps

Optional properties:
- qcom,sleep-clk-en: GPIO for sleep clock used for low power modes by 11ad card
- qcom,wigig-en: Enable GPIO connected to 11ad card

Example:
	wil6210: qcom,wil6210 {
		compatible = "qcom,wil6210";
		qcom,smmu-support;
		qcom,pcie-parent = <&pcie1>;
		qcom,wigig-en = <&tlmm 94 0>;
		qcom,msm-bus,name = "wil6210";
		qcom,msm-bus,num-cases = <2>;
		qcom,msm-bus,num-paths = <1>;
		qcom,msm-bus,vectors-KBps =
			<100 512 0 0>,
			<100 512 600000 800000>; /* ~4.6Gbps (MCS12) */
	};
