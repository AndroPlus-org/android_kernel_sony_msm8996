RAM Oops/Panic logger

Ramoops is an oops/panic logger that writes its logs to RAM before the system
crashes. It works by logging oopses and panics in a circular buffer.
Ramoops uses a reserved memory area to store the dump. The start and size
of the memory area are set using two variables:

"mem_address" for the start.
"mem_size" for the size.

Ramoops must reserve memory using the msm specific memory reservation
bindings (see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/msm/memory-reserve.txt).

Required properties

-compatible: "pstore-ramoops"
-linux,contiguous-region: phandle reference to a pstore reserve memory

Example:
	ramoops {
		compatible = "pstore-ramoops";
		linux,contiguous-region = <&pstore_reserve_mem>
	};
